# Fuel Consumption Analysis
This repository contains a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmettyilmazz/fuel-consumption) of fuel consumption for various vehicles between the years 2000 and 2022. The data is stored in a csv file and includes information on the make, model, vehicle class, fuel type, and combined fuel efficiency of each vehicle.
# Project Description
### Normalizing the data
Before analyzing the data, we first normalize it to ensure consistency in the data. The normalization process includes converting the make and vehicle class fields to uppercase, and updating the vehicle class field to group similar vehicle types together.

### Analyzing the Data
We can perform various analyses on the dataset to gain insights into fuel consumption trends for different types of vehicles. Some of the analyses performed on the dataset include:

* Identifying the most commonly used fuel type across all vehicles
* Determining the most popular fuel type used each year
* Ranking car brands by combined fuel efficiency
* Calculating the average fuel consumption by vehicle class

All SQL queries used to perform these analyses are included in this repository for reference.

Additionally, you can see some [visualizations](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/amiran.makharadze/viz/FuelConsumptionAnalysis_16761523000720/Dashboard1#1) related to this analysis.
